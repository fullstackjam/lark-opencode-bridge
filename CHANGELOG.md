# Changelog

All notable changes to **lark-opencode-bridge** are documented here.
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Doc-comment ack reaction** — when the bot is @mentioned in a cloud-doc
  comment, it now adds a 🧑‍💻 `Typing` (敲代码) reaction to the triggering reply
  as soon as it starts working, and removes the reaction once the answer is
  posted back. This gives commenters a clear "working → done" signal.
  Reaction add/remove are best-effort and never block the reply flow.
  Implemented via `drive.v2.commentReaction.updateReaction`
  (`CommentFetcher.reactToReply`).
